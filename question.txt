Objective: Design a backend for a simplified version of Pathao focusing on ride requests and management.
Acceptance Criteria:
Users can request a ride by selecting a location for pickup, and their destination. Assume that there are fixed locations for pickup and dropoff which users / drivers can select from their app. E.g. Banani, Mohakhali, Uttara - these can be locations for pickup / dropoff.
Drivers can view available ride requests and accept or reject them
Once a ride is accepted, it is removed from the list of available rides.
Drivers can mark rides as completed once they reach the destination.
Given a list of ride information, write a function that returns the top N routes used based on number of rides. Location A to B and B to A should be considered as the same route. The list should be ordered by most popular first.
Users can fetch the list of their past rides ordered by most recent. The list should include pickup and dropoff locations, the driver’s name, and the ride’s rating.
Bonus Problem:
Implement an area search to find drivers in a user’s nearby location. For example, given a user’s location coordinates, it should find all the available drivers within a certain radius
Users can rate their driver after completing a ride, and the ride history should include the driver's average rating
